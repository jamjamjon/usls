//! Linear algebra operations for tensors
//!
//! This module provides linear algebra operations including matrix multiplication,
//! argmax, argmin, and other related operations.
//!
//! Note: All linear algebra methods are implemented in impl.rs to avoid
//! duplicate definitions. This module serves as documentation and organization.
//!
//! Available methods:
//! - Matrix operations: matmul
//! - Index operations: argmax, argmin
//! - Activation functions: softmax
//! - Broadcasting: broadcast

// All linear algebra implementations are in impl.rs
// No imports needed here as this is documentation only

// All linear algebra implementations are in impl.rs
// This prevents duplicate definition compilation errors
