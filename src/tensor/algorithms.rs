//! Tensor algorithms and mathematical operations
//!
//! This module provides mathematical operations for tensors,
//! including aggregation, linear algebra, and shape manipulation operations.
//!
//! Note: All tensor algorithm methods are implemented in impl.rs to avoid
//! duplicate definitions. This module serves as documentation and organization.
//!
//! Available methods:
//! - Aggregation: sum, min, max, argmax, argmin
//! - Linear algebra: dot, matmul
//! - Shape manipulation: concat, stack, reshape, squeeze, unsqueeze, flatten, permute
//! - Activation functions: sigmoid, softmax
//! - Utility: clamp, broadcast

// All algorithm implementations are in impl.rs
// No imports needed here as this is documentation only

// All tensor algorithm implementations are in impl.rs
// This prevents duplicate definition compilation errors
